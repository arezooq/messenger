# Hexagonal architecture or ports and adapters 

Hexagonal architecture is introduced by Alistair Cockburn and written on his blog in 2005.
It represents business logic. It does not care about your framework development, your technology stack and your language code. It helps you define decoupled code structure, isolated with external components and easy-to-run tests.
